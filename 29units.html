        <h2>CSS UNITS</h2>
        <p>A CSS unit determines the size of a property you're setting for an element or its content. For example, if you wanted to set the property margin of a paragraph, you would give it a specific value. ... In this case, margin is the property, 20px;
            is the value, and px (or “pixel”) is the CSS unit.</p>
